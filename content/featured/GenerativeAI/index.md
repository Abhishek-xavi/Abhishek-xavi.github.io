- Developed an Auto encoder to generate sketch from images and vice versa.
- Explored Data augmentation techniques.
- Tuned a Convolutional grid neural network.
- Compared performance of a Convolutional Auto encoder, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Convolutional GAN and, attention mechanism incorporated GAN.
