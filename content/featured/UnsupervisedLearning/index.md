- Performed segmentation on the weather data of Switzerland Basil using Unsupervised Learning.
- High Dimensional data was reduced using Principal component Analysis.
- Data was modelled with K-Means and Gaussian Mixture models to compare distance based and probabilistics based approaches.
- Meaningful clusters were formed and explained with evidence.
